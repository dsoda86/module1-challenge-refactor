# module1-challenge-refactor

## Description

This module 1 challenge assignment's topic was code refactoring. We were given an index.html file and a style.css file for a marketing agency's (Horiseon) webpage that we had to review and make corrections to. The changes made will increase the page's web accessibility, which is important for people with disabilities to be able to access and navigate the webpage effectively; as well as increase it's search engine optimization. In this challenge I learned to thoroughly read the README.md file for the assignment because I had missed the guidance hints before the acceptance criteria. This would have streamlined my work instead of scanning and jumping around different parts of the files. I also learned that it is good practice to monitor changes made in the code on the live page to make sure what was changed was done correctly and did not break the webpage.

The application looks the same after refactoring the code and following the Scout Rule.
